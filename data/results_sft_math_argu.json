Similarly, letting $x=0$ gives $\\frac{y}{12} = 1$, so $y=12$, which means $b=12$.  There are several ways we can find the slope.  First, we could put the equation in slope-intercept form by subtracting $\\frac{x}{4}$ from both sides, and then multiplying by 12.  This gives $y = -3x +12$, which tells us that the slope is $-3$ (and confirms our solution for the $y$-intercept).  We also could have noted that since we have already shown that $(4,0)$ and $(0,12)$ are on the line, the slope of the line is $\\frac{12 -0}{0-4} = -3$.

The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty.

        "reply": " The acceleration due to gravity is approximately $9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2$. Let's call the acceleration of Jen's ball \"a\" and the acceleration of Jack's baseball \"b\". We know that the relationship between the force, mass, and acceleration is given by Newton's second law: F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. For Jen's ball, the force is equal to its mass times its acceleration, so we have a = 200g * b. For Jack's baseball, the force is equal to its mass times its acceleration, so we have b = 150g * a. Substituting the first equation into the second gives us b = 150g * (200g * b) = 30000bg. This means that the acceleration of Jack's baseball is three times the acceleration of Jen's ball. Therefore, the ratio of the accelerations is 3:1. \n#### 3",
