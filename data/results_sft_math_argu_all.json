We can ``unfold'' the walls that the gecko traveled along, as below, to represent the gecko's path in two dimensions. This unfolding does not change the length of the gecko's path, so in order for the gecko's path to be minimal before unfolding, it must be minimal after unfolding. In other words, it must be a straight line after unfolding. Now, besides the side walls, the gecko can travel along the front, back, and ceiling. Suppose that among these, it only travels along the front wall. The walls the gecko walked along unfold as such: [asy]\ndraw( (0,0)--(10,0)--(10,8)--(0,8)--cycle ); draw( (10,0)--(22,0) ); draw( (10,8)--(22,8) );\ndraw( (22,0)--(32,0)--(32,8)--(22,8)--cycle );\npair g = (31,7); pair f = (9,1);\ndot(g, green); dot(f, purple);\ndraw(g--f, red);\ndraw(f--(31,1), red+dashed); draw(g--(31,1), red+dashed);\nlabel( \"10\", (0,0)--(10,0) ); label( \"12\", (10,0)--(22,0) ); label( \"10\", (22,0)--(32,0) ); label( \"8\", (32,0)--(32,8) );\n[/asy] The gecko's path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 6 and 22, so its length is $\\sqrt{6^2 + 22^2} = 2\\sqrt{3^2 + 11^2} = 2\\sqrt{130}$. By symmetry (the gecko and the fly are exactly opposite each other in the room), the path length is the same if the gecko only travels along the back wall and side walls.\n\nNow suppose the gecko only travels along the ceiling and side walls. These walls unfolded become: [asy]\ndraw( (0,0)--(8,0)--(8,10)--(0,10)--cycle ); draw( (8,0)--(20,0) ); draw( (8,10)--(20,10) );\ndraw( (20,0)--(28,0)--(28,10)--(20,10)--cycle );\npair g = (21,9); pair f = (1,1);\ndot(g, green); dot(f, purple);\ndraw(g--f, red);\ndraw(f--(21,1), red+dashed); draw(g--(21,1), red+dashed);\nlabel( \"8\", (0,0)--(8,0) ); label( \"12\", (8,0)--(20,0) ); label( \"8\", (20,0)--(28,0) ); label( \"10\", (28,0)--(28,10) );\n[/asy] The path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 8 and 20, so its length is $\\sqrt{8^2 + 20^2} = 2\\sqrt{4^2+10^2} = 2\\sqrt{116}$. (We'll keep it in this form because it makes it easier to compare with the other cases.)\n\nFinally, the gecko may cross both the ceiling and front wall (or back wall; the cases give the same results by symmetry).

        "answer": "Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are\n$$\\pm 1,~\\pm 2,~\\pm 3,~\\pm 6,~\\pm 11,~\\pm 22,~\\pm 33,~\\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.\n\nNow we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\\cdot\\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.\n\nWe now consider two cases.\n\nCase 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$. In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $32$.\n\nThe alternative, Case 2, is that one of $11,-11$ is a root and one of $3,-3$ is a root. Again, the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\\cdot 2=14$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\\\\n&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,\n\\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots.
