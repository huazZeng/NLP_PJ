Here is the problem:
Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Human beings have no idea how to do something like that. 

I mean, I've had my share of trouble with this type of thing before, but not on purpose. 

My first attempt was to make up a story about some guy who's just lost his wallet and needs to buy a new one. The next day, he went shopping at Walmart. He looked around, saw a pair of shoes and decided to try them on. He walked out of the store feeling very happy because he had found what he wanted. 

The second attempt was when I was trying to find a job. One day, I was looking through the classifieds and saw an ad for a part-time position. I checked out the profile and got excited. I sent myself an email and waited patiently for someone to respond. After five minutes, I received a message from an employer saying they would be interviewing me within two weeks. 

The third attempt was when I was playing video games. I tried to find a game that I liked. I played several hours of different games and finally found a game called "Sonic the Hedgehog". 

The fourth attempt was when I was reading a book. I started flipping through the pages and eventually found the chapter where I learned about the concept of infinity.
